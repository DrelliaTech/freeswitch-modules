# freeswitch-modules

Custom FreeSWITCH image with `mod_audio_fork` for bidirectional WebSocket audio streaming. Originally based on code from [drachtio-freeswitch-modules](https://github.com/dochong/drachtio-freeswitch-modules), heavily modified and trimmed to a single module.

## mod_audio_fork

Attaches a media bug to a FreeSWITCH channel and streams bidirectional audio over a WebSocket connection.

**Upstream behavior** (send-only): Captures call audio in L16 format and streams it to a remote WebSocket server.

**Our additions** (bidirectional): Binary audio frames received on the WebSocket are buffered in a ring buffer and injected back into the call via `SMBF_WRITE_REPLACE`. This enables real-time TTS playback without file I/O — synthesized audio is streamed back through the same WebSocket that carries STT audio.

### API

```
uuid_audio_fork <uuid> start <wss-url> <mix-type> [metadata]
uuid_audio_fork <uuid> stop
```

- `mix-type`: `mono` (caller only), `mixed` (both parties, single channel), `stereo` (two channels)
- `metadata`: optional JSON sent as initial text frame after connection

## Building

The Dockerfile builds FreeSWITCH 1.10 from source (with only the modules needed for WebSocket audio streaming) and compiles `mod_audio_fork` on top.

```bash
docker build -t drellia/freeswitch-mrf .
```

The first build takes a while (~15-20 min) since it compiles FreeSWITCH from source. Subsequent builds are fast due to Docker layer caching — only the `mod_audio_fork` compilation layer is re-run when module code changes.
